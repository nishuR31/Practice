## 🧪 How It Works

1. The form collects user input (name, job title, age, bio, and image).
2. JavaScript binds the input fields to the preview section.
3. When the user types or uploads a file, the preview updates instantly.
4. The "Toggle Preview" button shows/hides the preview using a debounce to avoid flickering or rapid toggles.
